Dead. I originally intended to rewrite this with FastAPI and update it but.. Novel Updates uses Cloudflare and its not scraping friendly anymore. I could bypass some of it with cloudscrape but its synchronous and defeats the purpose of an asynchronous API. Then there is the Captcha wall, only way around that reliably is using a paid service which I am not about to do for a pet project.
